    title: "FRM Financial Risk Meter for Emerging Markets"
    description: "Authors: Ben Amor, Souhir and Michael Althoff<br/>
    <p>Abstract:  Emerging Markets (EM) have become an attractive investment target due
    to the fast growing economic and the increasing of liquidity and transparency.
    However, these markets are characterised by a high level of volatility due to
    external price shocks, and domestic policy instability. Therefore, an efficient
    risk measure and hedging strategy are needed to help the market players to hedge their
    investments against this risk. In this paper, a daily systemic risk measure,
    called FRM (Financial Risk Meter) is proposed. The FRM is based on Lasso quantile
    regression designed to capture tail event co-movements. In practice, FRM is applied
    to the return time series of selected financial institutions and macroeconomic risk
    factors. Using FRM, we identify companies exhibiting extreme ''co-stress'', as well as
    ''activators'' of stress. Therefore, FRM Emerging Markets is applied to capture systemic
    risk behaviour embedded in the returns of the 25 largest Emerging Markets financial
    institutions, covering the BRIMST (Brazil, Russia, India, Mexico, South Africa, Turkey),
    and thereby reflects the financial linkages between these economies. Concerning the
    macroeconomic risk factors, in addition to the Adrian and Brunnermaier (2016)
    macroeconomic risk factors, we used the Emerging Market yield spread over respective
     US Treasuries, and the above mentioned countries' currencies. Therefore, we studied
     the relationship between those factors and tail event network behaviour to build our
     policy recommendations in order to help the investors to choose the suitable market
     for investment and then to optimise their portfolio. The results indicated that
     Emerging Market financial institutions were as much impacted by the crisis from
     mid-March 2020 onwards.</p>"

  title: "Dynamic density forecasting using machine learning"
  description: "Authors: Lubos Hanus and Jozef Barunik<br/>
  <p>Abstract:  The use of machine learning techniques is proposed to describe and forecast the conditional probability distribution of asset returns. We redefine the problem of forecasting of conditional probabilities looking from a different perspective than traditional ordered binary choice models. Using deep learning methods, we offer a better description of asset returns distribution. The study on the most liquid U.S. stocks shows that predictive performance of machine learning methods is promising out-of-sample. We provide a comparison of machine learning methods to the unordered and order binary choice models used by the literature.</p>"

  description: "Authors: Martin Hronec and Jozef Barunik<br/>
  <p>Abstract:  A large scale empirical test is performed for an asset pricing model based on agents with quantile utility preferences instead of the standard expected utility. Using machine learning methods, we predict quantiles of individual stock returns obtaining the whole forecasted distributions. We document heterogeneity in models parameters across different quantiles. We show that forecasting all quantiles together, using multi-task deep learning is better than forecasting quantiles individually. The forecasting models allow us to construct portfolios based on the whole distribution instead of just a conditional mean. We show the economic value added of looking at the whole forecasted distribution by forming quantile-based long-short portfolios, as well as favourably forecasting value-at-risk.</p>"

    title: "Jumps in cryptocurrencies"
    description: "Authors: Danial Saef<br/>
    <p>Abstract:  Jumps in financial time series, especially if they are in high frequency, are difficult to detect.
    We evaluate the applicability of existing jump test methodologies as in Lee and Mykland (2012), and
    Ait-Sahalia and Jacod (2012) on a diverse cryptocurrency tick dataset. Cryptocurrency markets are highly capitalised,
    yet they differ from traditional markets due to non-stop trading, lower volume and high correlation among currencies.
    These properties cause larger volatility and make them more vulnerable to contagion effects. Existing jump test
    methodologies are difficult to apply to cryptocurrencies as they do not address these market specific properties.
    The evaluation shows that the number of jumps per day differs according to the chosen method. However, both
    frameworks agree that the frequency of jumps is time-varying and subject to clustering effects. We conclude that
    existing methodologies should be extended to account for contagion effects and clustered jumps, and provide
    suggestions on how to extend the existing methodologies accordingly.</p>"

    title: "A Machine Learning Based Regulatory Risk Index for Cryptocurrencies"
    description: "Authors: Xinwen Ni, Wolfgang K. Härdle<br/>
    <p>Abstract: Despite regulators’ best intentions to protect consumers and to avoid money launder- ing, terrorist finance, or other illicit activities, cryptocurrencies’ values remain heavily tied to drastic policy changes, as several prominent examples revealed over the past years. Indices have been constructed to track the Cryptocurrency markets, however, none of these indices directly address regulatory risks. In this paper, we aim to quantify the risks originating from introducing regulations on the cryptocurrency markets and identify their impact on the cryptocurrency investments. conduct a regulatory risk index for the cryptocurrency market base on the policy-related news coverage frequency. The news data are collected from the top online cryptocurrency news platforms. A LDA model was trained to obtain the topics and was applied to calculate the distance between news to solve the problem of semantic similarity as a binary decision problem in which an article is policy related or not. Our regulatory risk index successfully captures those big policy changing moments. The movements for both VCRIX, a market volatility index, and the regulatory risk index are synchronous, meaning that the index could be helpful for all participants in the cryptocurrency market. The algorithms and Python code are available for research purposes on www.quantlet.de.
