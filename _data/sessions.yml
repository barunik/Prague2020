    title: "Jumps in cryptocurrencies"
    description: "Authors: Danial Saef<br/>
    <p>Abstract:  Jumps in financial time series, especially if they are in high frequency, are difficult to detect.
    We evaluate the applicability of existing jump test methodologies as in Lee and Mykland (2012), and
    Ait-Sahalia and Jacod (2012) on a diverse cryptocurrency tick dataset. Cryptocurrency markets are highly capitalised,
    yet they differ from traditional markets due to non-stop trading, lower volume and high correlation among currencies.
    These properties cause larger volatility and make them more vulnerable to contagion effects. Existing jump test
    methodologies are difficult to apply to cryptocurrencies as they do not address these market specific properties.
    The evaluation shows that the number of jumps per day differs according to the chosen method. However, both
    frameworks agree that the frequency of jumps is time-varying and subject to clustering effects. We conclude that
    existing methodologies should be extended to account for contagion effects and clustered jumps, and provide
    suggestions on how to extend the existing methodologies accordingly.</p>"
